LD30
====

This was my entry for Ludum Dare 30, a 48 hour competition to write a game from scratch. It was the first time I'd entered the competition and I ended up putting less than 24 hours total. The theme for the comp was "Connected Worlds".

Not much to it. If you want to check out out, you can play it here.
